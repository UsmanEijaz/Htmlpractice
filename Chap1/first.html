            Hi, I am Alqama Bin Sadiq, I just started learning html so I thought it's good to help others as well in learning html.<br />
            Html is a hyper text markup language and it is used to create the structure of web pages and writing content on web pages.<hr />
            here I used an empty element horizontal rule to seperate this section.
